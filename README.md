12_camera: In its current state, for it to work, you have to manually give it `storage` permissions!

## 18_coronaviews

A group project.

### Ideas

Locations where one can go during Corona while social distancing (parks, forests etc. - places with lots of space and generally few people).

1. There's a list of categories: Lakes, parks, forests etc.
2. Click a category and it shows you a map of all the places in that category.
3. Click a pin on the map, and it shows you the place's name and some info about it in the form of text (fx. specific rules, like no running) and images.

<hr>

- Bonus feature #1: There might also be a list of places one cannot go, like Islands Brygge.
- Bonus feature #2: Add location API integration, so you can order the places after how close they are to you, telling you the distance
- Bonus feature #3: Use of a relevant Corona related API

### Questions

How many pages/activities total?

## diary_exam

This was my exam project so it was the most advanced one besides the group project, using login, taking photos, resizing them and sending them to firestore
and recyclerview with custom row. Recording sound was a work in progress.
